	René Descartes was born in France on March 31, 1596.  He attended a Jesuit school, where he displayed a love of mathematics. He studied law at the University of Poitiers 
for two years. “...During this active period in Descartes's life, he formed a friendship with the Dutch philosopher and scientist Isaac Beeckman, who familiarized Descartes with
contemporary developments in mathematics.” He loved mathematics as a child. He found someone who shared the same interests as him. 
	René Descartes became famous in 1628 for writing his works on math and philosophy. " His most influential work, Discours de la methode, ( Discourse on Method) originally
appeared as the preface of a 1637 volume devoted to mathematics and physical science. " This work was important because he was a thinker. All of his work was important but this 
one peice of work made his ideas known.
	You should care about what René Descartes did because he helped with analytic geometry. "As a mathematician, Descartes's most important contribution was his discovery of
the principles that ultimately developed into the field of analytic geometry." His name is in analytic geometry as a cartesian plane. He loved math and devoted his life to it.
